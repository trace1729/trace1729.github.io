# Encrypt

-   Decrypt `file1.txt.gpg` with the password `ocfdecal` (_for real-life purposes, never store passwords in plaintext_). What are the decrypted contents of `file1.txt.gpg`?

    command `gpg -d file1.txt.gpg` 
    quack

-   What command allows you to import a key?

    `gpg --import ` 

-   What command allows you to export a key to a file? (Add the `--armor` flag to ASCII-encode the key so it can be sent easily in text form)

    `gpg --export --armor` 

-   What command allows you to see all of the keys on your keyring?

    `gpg --list-keys` 

-   Use the private key `lab7privkey` to decrypt the file `file2.txt.gpg` (_for real-life purposes, it is necessary to keep private keys secret_). What are the decrypted contents of `b8/file2.txt.gpg`?

        gpg --import lab7privkey 
        gpg -d file2.txt.gpg
